Yet another comparison slider... I've looked everywhere for a simple, responsive and tiny slider (less than 3KB), to no avail.
Found this: https://github.com/Paul-Browne/image-comparison-slider/blob/master/image-comparison-slider.js
But it needed a little more work to suite my need (optimization, responsiveness and support touch mobile devices)

# Size
This slider js is ~2KB minified (less gzipped), that is TINY! and the css is >1KB which is also insignificant.

# How to use
Clone this repo, and take a look at the example HTML in the example folder. should be straight-forward.

# Build from source
`npm start` will run both the css and js minifiers on the src folder. Results are added to the dist folder
